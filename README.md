# Rooftop_Segmentation
The presented code represents the implementation of a U-Net model for semantic segmentation of aerial images using the AIRS dataset. The dataset consists of satellite images and corresponding segmented masks for roof structures. The U-Net model is trained on a set of 178 images and validated on 11 images, with a focus on evaluating metrics such as Intersection over Union (IOU), Dice Coefficient, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The model demonstrates promising results in segmenting buildings. Additionally, a function is provided to draw bounding boxes and fill identified buildings on the segmented masks, enhancing the visual interpretation of the model's performance.
